# Contributing to Parse SDK for .NET

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

### Pull Requests

PRs are welcomed!

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

## Style Guide

- Please ALWAYS unwrap your long methods to enhance readability. If your code is quickly readable, then we can quickly sketch out what it does, but if wrapped, it gets UNNECESSARILY longer to understand.

* Most importantly, match the existing code style as much as possible.
* Try to keep lines under 120 characters, if possible.
